## Description
The "LibraTrack Library Management System" is a web application that helps users manage books, members, and borrowing activities in a small library setup.
Instead of using manual logs or spreadsheets, LibraTrack provides an organized system where you can add books, register members, and track which books are borrowed or returned — all in one place.

### Features
-Add, view, update, and delete books. -Register and manage library members. -Record book borrowing and returning. -Prevent borrowing of already-loaned books. -Clean user interface for quick library operations. -Data is handled through a FastAPI backend to ensure smooth performance.

### Learning Goals
-Understand how to build a complete CRUD application. -Learn how the frontend (React) interacts with a backend (FastAPI). -Practice making API calls. -Learn error handling when data is missing, delayed, or unavailable. -Build a functional app before adding advanced features.
